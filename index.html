      <h4>Poverty is a situation that an individual goes through who does not have the necessary resources to live
        stably, which prevents the person's basic needs from being met. This can cause the physical and emotional health
        of the individual experiencing poverty due to lack of resources to be affected. Poverty can affect an
        individual, a group of people or unfortunately an entire geographic region.</h4>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>In short, poverty is a social problem that can reach an individual or group less privileged by one or several
        factors in their environment. It can be aggravated if the individual has at least one social deprivation and her
        income is insufficient to obtain the goods or services that she requires and that prevents her from covering her
        basic needs.</h4>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Extreme Poverty: </em> A person who has three or more deprivations, out of a possible six, is also below
        the minimum well-being line.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Moderate Poverty: </em> Person who, being poor, is not extremely poor. Moderate poverty is obtained by
        calculating the difference between the incidence of the population in poverty minus that of the population in
        extreme poverty.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Multidimensional Poverty: </em> The word multidimensional refers to the fact that the poverty measurement
        methodology uses several dimensions or economic and social factors in its conception and definition.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Income Poverty: </em> Income poverty consists of comparing people's income with the monetary values of
        different food lines, capabilities, and assets:</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Food Poverty: </em> Inability to obtain a basic food basket.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4><em>The Poverty of Capacities: </em> Insufficient income available to acquire the value of the food basket and
        make the necessary expenses in health and education.</h4>

      <p>
      <h4><em>Patrimony Poverty: </em> Insufficient income available to purchase the food basket, as well as make the
        necessary expenses in health, clothing, housing, transportation, and education.</h4>

      <p>
      <h4>Poverty is one of the main social problems in Puerto Rico.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4>When the 1940s arrived, Puerto Rico was so poor that it was called "the Poor House of the Caribbean." The per
        capita income was $121. Almost half of the adult population of a total 1.1 million inhabitants, was unemployed.

      </p>

      <p>
      <h4>The economic recession, the dismissal of thousands of workers, the imposition of the Fiscal Supervision Board
        and the onslaught of atmospheric phenomena have been circumstances that have affected the increase in poverty
        and economic inequality on the island.</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h4>On the other hand, Hurricane Maria, which occurred in 2017, completely devastated the island of Puerto Rico.
        This caused many homes to be affected or destroyed, without roofs, windows and necessary items that were in the
        home. Many homes were flooded and collapsed from the winds. Another reason why homes have collapsed is that, due
        to the winds, palms, trunks, and other things fell into the houses and caused them to collapse. The people who
        were affected some lost relatives, lost their homes, and were in poverty.</h4>
